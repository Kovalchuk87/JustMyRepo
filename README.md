Here is my framework for automated testing presented.
Framework is based on PLaywright and uses page object pattern.
The app under the test is an e-store.
Framework uses:
  - ajv for JSON schema validation;
  - eslint as a prettier;
  - Playwright build-in reporter.
Framework is configurated to run on stage and prod environments.
